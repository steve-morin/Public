**Cloud Computing Overview**

This informational paper is intended to provide a short example of my written communication. Note that it is written in an informal style and is intended to be informational in nature. This paper provides a brief overview of Cloud Computing and brief introduction to the three leading cloud computing platforms: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google (GCP). 

**Introduction**
Cloud computing is growing rapidly and is quickly changing the IT landscape and world as we know it. It presents substantial benefits and advantages over current models. It provides businesses with the ability to flexibly scale up or down with improved reliability. It allows customers to tap into the economies of scale created by the large technology companies. Cloud computing market leaders have invested in building out global technology infrastructure that provides exceptional compute, storage, and network services. Moreover, they provide excellent security and monitoring services to ensure that their customers data is protected.
Cloud Computing is defined as “a remote virtual pool of on-demand shared resources offering Compute, Storage, Database, and Network services that can be rapidly deployed at scale”. Virtualization has been a significant enabler for the move to the Cloud by allowing the possibility of having several virtual machines (VMs), each running separate sets of workloads installed on a single physical server. This allows for hardware sharing through a 'hypervisor' and provides the ability to make more efficient use of resources. Virtualization has provided several bottom-live benefits: smaller IT infrastructure footprint, reduced capital expenditure, reduced operating costs, and resource optimization.
Cloud Computing service providers deliver services in the following areas:

•	Compute: CPU and RAM that provides processing for the workload
•	Storage: Provides a robust service to save and store data. Comprised of SAN, hard disks, and network attached storage.
•	Database: Stores and manages structured data. Relational Databases: SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL.  NoSQL: MongoDB, CosmosDB, DynamoDB.
•	Network Resources: Provides the means for other resources to communicate. Comprised of firewalls, routes, switches, etc.
•	PaaS & SaaS Services: Numerous PaaS & SaaS services are offered by major Cloud vendors. Examples include Office 365 and Gmail.
 
**Cloud Deployment Models**
**Public Cloud**
Under this model cloud vendors provide shared compute, storage, database, and network infrastructure for public usage via an internet connection. Users can specify the geographic region that a service will be provided from but will not know the precise physical location(s) of the infrastructure being used. Cloud vendors provide all services for maintaining data centre operations including hardware maintenance, power, and cooling. Due to the scale of shared infrastructure, consumers can benefit from economies of scale in terms of pricing and quality of services provided.

**Private Cloud**
A private cloud model uses infrastructure that is privately managed, hosted, and owned by the company using it. This provides the owner/user with more direct control over data and the behavior of the infrastructure. Organizations that require a greater degree of security may adopt this architecture. This model makes use of virtualization to create a pool of shared compute/storage/network resources.  Maintenance and operation will require additional resources to support this model in comparison to the public cloud model.

**Hybrid Cloud**
This model makes use of both public and private clouds and provides the advantages of both public and private cloud models. A network link is usually established between the public and private environments. This model can support disaster recovery, backup, or seasonal growth needs.

**Cloud Service Models**
Cloud service models fall into three main categories: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

**Software as a Service**
SaaS allows for delivery of an application that can be widely distributed and accessed (Gmail is an example of SaaS). SaaS applications are accessed over the internet and is fully managed by the service provider

**Platform as a Service**
This model offers more control than SaaS, allowing the customer to control from the Operating System up. The underlying infrastructure is managed by the cloud vendor and these services are commonly used by Developers. Vendors offer appealing pricing options and application maintenance models.

**Infrastructure as a Service**
IaaS allows the greatest level of control and flexibility to the customer to design systems according to their needs while allowing them to take advantage of the benefits of a managed service. The service provider is responsible for maintaining all aspects of data centre infrastructure freeing up the customer to focus on their core business.
 
**Use Cases of Cloud Computing**
This section highlights common use cases for Cloud Computing.

**Migration of Production Services**
Moving production services from on-premise to the cloud is one of the most prevalent use cases. As mentioned above, there are numerous benefits associated with moving to the cloud including: flexibility, ability to scale, cost savings, reliability, disaster recovery. Many companies have moved most of their infrastructure to the Cloud.

**Experimentation/Proof of Concept**
The Cloud provides flexible, lower cost services that can be provisioned quickly to perform experiments and proof of concepts. Once experimentation is complete, resources can be easily deleted.

**Big Data & Advanced Analytics**
Cloud vendors provide low cost, flexible managed services to handle Big Data. These services make use of parallel computing to efficiently process large datasets. Also, these services provide customers with ability to use AI, machine learning, and cognitive services to process data and only pay for what is used.

**Elastic Scalability**
Cloud vendors provide simple services that allow users to scale up (or down) to support varying demand on systems due to sudden changes in business or seasonal changes.

**Disaster Recovery & Backup**
Cloud customers can take advantage of the resiliency and durability that has been engineered into Cloud platforms. The Cloud provides large amounts of low-cost storage accessible via the Internet that can be used for back-up. Cloud vendors provide options for Cold storage and allow data to be replicated to separate physical locations to increase data durability. 

**Web Hosting**
Cloud vendors provide the ability to load balance and easily scale web applications while reducing administration and maintenance.

**Development & Test Environments**
Dev & Test environments can quickly be provisioned or scaled according to changing need allowing for flexibility and cost optimization. This provides significant agility and flexibility when building and deploying IT assets.
 
**AWS**
Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the first entrant into the public cloud market in 2006. AWS holds the dominant position in the market with a 33% share. AWS has 175 services across categories providing developers with a significant depth and breadth of services. It achieved significant scale and geographical reach and is enterprise “friendly”. Its customers benefit from the maturity and continuous improvement of its services derived from its large customer base. As a result of its broad service offerings, it can be a more complex vendor to manage and navigate. Pricing can be a challenge to understand and the cost can still be a barrier for some potential customers.
**Azure**
Microsoft launched Azure in 2010 and has rapidly expanded on the heels of significant investment in global expansion. Overall, Microsoft is a safe, reliable choice for enterprises, due to existing relationships and “Enterprise Agreements”. Popular services such as Office 365, Teams, and SharePoint are important components in their portfolio. Microsoft has embraced open source software including Linux, the open source alternative to it’s Windows operating system. Azure provides all major functionality that other Cloud vendors provide, and its Azure portal is highly rated for usability and functionality. Azure has experienced slightly higher outages than AWS in recent years, however Microsoft is quickly working to close this gap. 
**GCP**
Google Cloud Platform entered the market in 2008. It has had difficulty gaining traction in the enterprise market but has appealed to many customers due to it strengths in analytics, machine learning, and AI. Google lacks sales and solutions representatives in comparison to its competitors making it difficult for potential customers to understand how solutions could be architected for GCP. Google has been involved in the development of Kubernetes which has become a standard technology for Cloud computing. It has the smallest footprint in terms of global availability.

**Conclusion**
Many organizations may use services from several of the leading cloud providers. There are some differences between leading cloud vendors, but they generally provide similar services and fill common requirements. Overall, AWS still leads the market due to the maturity and breadth of its service offerings. Azure has started to bridge the gap and its overall value proposition can be compelling for enterprise customers. Google could still be serious competitor in the near future but needs to establish itself as a mainstream enterprise option.

Regardless of the cloud vendor, the pay as you go model of cloud computing provides a persuasive business case for many companies. We will continue to see significant migration to the cloud in the coming years. The burning competition between the leading vendors will continue to benefit customers and users.
