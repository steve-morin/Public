**Title: Critical Thinking is Your Most Important Career Skill**


**Why you need Critical Thinking**
  
Your ability to think critically is the most important career skill and it's what every employer looks for. It is 'the' most important skillset and is needed by professionals so that they can deliver on their commitments and obligations. It has been described by some as logical self-defense, it gives you the tools to consider and assess information in order to make a judgement. In the era of information overload and constant influx of sophisticated marketing and influencing campaigns, critical thinking is also a survival skill for navigating your everyday life.

It is the ability to think in an organized and rational way to discern how facts or ideas are linked together, allowing you to make sense of what's in front of you. When you think critically, you’ll constantly challenge what seems given. Critical thinking helps you to identify new, better processes and solutions. Critical thinking skills are also the cornerstone of self-development and improvement. That’s why they’re so critical to have in today’s job market.
	 
   
Critical thinking is the ability to think clearly and rationally about what to do or what to believe. It includes the ability to engage in reflective and independent thinking. Someone with critical thinking skills is able to do the following :
 - understand the logical connections between ideas
 - identify, construct and evaluate arguments
 - detect inconsistencies and common mistakes in reasoning
 - solve problems systematically
 - identify the relevance and importance of ideas
 - reflect on the justification of one's own beliefs and values
    
Critical thinking is not a matter of accumulating information. A person with a good memory and who knows a lot of facts is not necessarily good at critical thinking. A critical thinker is able to deduce consequences from what he knows, and he knows how to make use of information to solve problems, and to seek relevant sources of information to inform himself.

Critical thinking should not be confused with being argumentative or being critical of other people. Although critical thinking skills can be used in exposing fallacies and bad reasoning, critical thinking can also play an important role in cooperative reasoning and constructive tasks. Critical thinking can help us acquire knowledge, improve our theories, and strengthen arguments. We can use critical thinking to enhance work processes and improve social institutions.


Some people believe that critical thinking hinders creativity because it requires following the rules of logic and rationality, but creativity might require breaking rules. This is a misconception. Critical thinking is quite compatible with thinking "out-of-the-box", challenging consensus and pursuing less popular approaches. If anything, critical thinking is an essential part of creativity because we need critical thinking to evaluate and improve our creative ideas.
	 
   
**The importance of critical thinking**

Critical thinking is a domain-general thinking skill. The ability to think clearly and rationally is important whatever we choose to do. If you work in education, research, finance, management or the legal profession, then critical thinking is obviously important. But critical thinking skills are not restricted to a particular subject area. Being able to think well and solve problems systematically is an asset for any career.

Critical thinking is very important in the new knowledge economy. The global knowledge economy is driven by information and technology. One has to be able to deal with changes quickly and effectively. The new economy places increasing demands on flexible intellectual skills, and the ability to analyse information and integrate diverse sources of knowledge in solving problems. Good critical thinking promotes such thinking skills and is very important in the fast-changing workplace.

Critical thinking enhances language and presentation skills. Thinking clearly and systematically can improve the way we express our ideas. In learning how to analyse the logical structure of texts, critical thinking also improves comprehension abilities.
Critical thinking promotes creativity. To come up with a creative solution to a problem involves not just having new ideas. It must also be the case that the new ideas being generated are useful and relevant to the task at hand. Critical thinking plays a crucial role in evaluating new ideas, selecting the best ones and modifying them if necessary

Critical thinking is crucial for self-reflection. In order to live a meaningful life and to structure our lives accordingly, we need to justify and reflect on our values and decisions. Critical thinking provides the tools for this process of self-evaluation.

Good critical thinking is the foundation of science and democracy. Science requires the critical use of reason in experimentation and theory confirmation. The proper functioning of a liberal democracy requires citizens who can think critically about social issues to inform their judgments about proper governance and to overcome biases and prejudice.
	 
	 
**What is the critical thinking process?**

 1. Formulate the problem: Precisely identify the question/problem. This is a critical step in the process.
 2. Do your data gathering; facts, opinions, arguments. Try to find different representative points of view.
 3. Evaluate & analyze the data; are they from a reliable source, are they based on facts/data. Apply statistical methods/thinking to evaluate hypotheses.
 4. Identify your assumptions: List your assumptions, identify & recognize your and others biases
 5. Draw conclusions; Use the appropriate structured decision tools to draw conclusions based on options. Test conclusions with customers, colleagues to get feedback and adjust as needed.
 6. Communicate: Present your conclusions and findings but ensure you've done the work and gone through the above steps before you do so. Eventually, this process will become second nature and you will be able to go through the steps more quickly.
	 
**What are critical thinking skills?**

 - Analysis: the ability to collect and process information and knowledge.
 - Interpretation: concluding what the meaning of processed information is.
 - Inference: assessing whether the knowledge you have is sufficient and reliable.
 - Evaluation: the ability to make decisions based on the available information.
 - Explanation: communicating your findings and reasoning clearly.
 - Self-Regulation: the drive to constantly monitor and correct your ways of thinking.
 - Open-Mindedness: taking into account other possibilities and points of view.
 - Problem-Solving: the ability to tackle unexpected problems and resolve conflicts.
	 
If we want to think correctly, we need to follow the correct rules of reasoning. Knowledge of theory includes knowledge of these rules. These are the basic principles of critical thinking, such as the laws of logic, and the methods of scientific reasoning, etc.
Also, it would be useful to know something about what not to do if we want to reason correctly. This means we should have some basic knowledge of the mistakes that people make. First, this requires some knowledge of typical fallacies. Second, psychologists have discovered persistent biases and limitations in human reasoning. An awareness of these empirical findings will alert us to potential problems.

**How to improve your critical thinking skills?**
Good critical thinking skills require not just knowledge and practice. Persistent practice can bring about improvements only if one has the right kind of motivation and attitude. To improve our thinking we have to recognize that the importance of reflecting on the reasons for belief and action. We should also be willing to engage in debate, break old habits, and deal with linguistic complexities and abstract concepts.

However, merely knowing the principles that distinguish good and bad reasoning is not enough. We might study in the classroom about how to swim, and learn about the basic theory, such as the fact that one should not breathe under water. But unless we can apply such theoretical knowledge through constant practice, we might not actually be able to swim.

Similarly, to be good at critical thinking skills it is necessary to internalize the theoretical principles so that we can actually apply them in daily life. There are at least two ways. One is to do lots of good-quality exercises. Exercises include not just exercises in classrooms and tutorials. They also include exercises in the form of discussion and debates with other people in our daily life. The other method is to think more deeply about the principles that we have acquired. In the human mind, memory and understanding are acquired through making connections between ideas.

1. Become a self critic
2. Active listening - this is important
3. Analyzing information
4. Developing foresight - Predict how events could unfold
5. Don't take anything at Face Value
6. Consider motive
7. Do your research
8. Ask Questions
9. Don't assume you're right
10. Break the problem down into smaller pieces
11. Keep it simple (Occam's razor) - the simplest explanation that fits the facts
12. Ask simple critical thinking questions
			1. What do I already know?
			2. What are the sources?
			3. What is the objective?
			4. What are motivations?
13. Oppose “common sense”
14. Be aware of biases
15. Read alot


**Wrapping Up**

In this article we have examined what critical thinking is and how it involves more than simply being critical. Understanding critical thinking helps in formulating and studying arguments. We see arguments every day in advertising, use arguments to persuade others, and we use them to benefit us. The overview of fallacies showed not all arguments are valid or even logical. Always critically think and examine any argument you confront and remember that if it sounds too good to be true, it may be a fallacious argument.

We practice critical thinking on a daily basis, often without any extra effort. By understanding the process, you should find that you can put together more persuasive arguments that avoid the pitfalls of fallacious thinking. As you process information, you will be more prepared to think critically about the statement and will be in a position to make a more educated decision about the information.
